# SmartHealthSystem  
### AI-Powered Clinic Appointment and Queue Management Platform  

---

## Overview
**SmartHealthSystem** is an AI-driven healthcare platform designed to reduce long waiting times at public clinics by intelligently scheduling, managing, and updating patient appointments in real-time.  

Built for the **IBM Z Datathon**, the project leverages **IBM Z LinuxONE** to demonstrate how powerful, secure, and scalable enterprise systems can transform public healthcare efficiency through technology.

## Problem Statement
In many regions, patients spend **hours waiting in queues** at clinics to collect medication or receive care — often due to poor scheduling, last-minute cancellations, or inefficient communication.  
This results in:
- Overcrowding and staff burnout  
- Missed or delayed treatments  
- Poor patient experience  

**SmartHealthSystem** solves this by introducing an intelligent, automated appointment system powered by AI and deployed on IBM Z infrastructure.

## Solution Summary
SmartHealthSystem enables patients to:
- **Book appointments easily** via web, mobile,  
- **Receive smart notifications** (SMS/WhatsApp) when slots open or appointments change  
- **Join a dynamic waitlist** to get earlier slots automatically when someone cancels  
- **Leverage AI predictions** to distribute clinic traffic evenly and reduce congestion  

Clinic staff benefit from a live dashboard to view bookings, handle cancellations, and track patient flow in real time.

##Wow Factor
The **WOW factor** of SmartHealthSystem lies in its **real-time AI-driven optimization** — dynamically reallocating open slots, predicting peak times, and ensuring clinics run efficiently with minimal human intervention.  
Combined with **IBM Z’s reliability and security**, it demonstrates how high-performance computing can power inclusive, scalable healthcare systems accessible to everyone.
